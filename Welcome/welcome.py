             You find yourselves in the app for Data Analytics Dashboard developed by
             the students of MAIT 21/22 program of TH KÃ¶ln.

             It allows you to:
             - Upload your own datasets
             - Rename and drop columns within them
             - Smooth, filter and interpolate
             - Perform advanced machine learning with customizable parameters on you data
             - Visualize and download the results

                0. **Welcome:** This is where you currently are
                1. **Data Preview:**  You can have a look at your dataset in general and spot some correlations between the features
                2. **Data Preparation:** Drop and/or rename single/multiple columns, don't forget to submit changes
                3. **Smoothing and Filtering:** Use a multitude of tools to trim or adjust your data to increase its quality. Don't forget to save and finalize the results! Even if you didn't change anything :)
                4. **Classification:** You can perform several classification methods (e.g. Random Forest) and get results as visualization and datasheet.  
                5. **Regression:** Predict the next data points using Neural Networks, Random Forest and other algorithms
